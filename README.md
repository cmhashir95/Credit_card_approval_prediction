# Predicting Credit Card Default Risk Using Machine Learning
A machine learning project to predict credit card default risk by integrating customer profiles with high-volume transactional data, performing extensive EDA, resolving data-quality issues, engineering meaningful financial features, and developing optimized classification models.

# Project Overview
Credit card defaults pose significant financial risk to banks and lending institutions. This project builds a scalable machine learning solution to predict high-risk customers by combining 40,000 customer demographic records with 10M+ transaction records.
The goal is to identify early warning signals and support data-driven credit risk strategies.


# Key Objectives
Build an end-to-end ML pipeline for credit default prediction
Clean and preprocess large-scale transactional data
Address severe class imbalance (only 1.5% defaulters)
Evaluate and compare ML classification models
Achieve high ROC-AUC and stable recall for reliable risk estimation

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
SQL (joins, aggregations, deduplication logic)
Machine Learning: Decision Tree, Random Forest, GridSearchCV
Jupyter Notebook for development and reporting
